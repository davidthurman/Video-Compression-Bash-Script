# Video-Compression-Bash-Script
This allows you to compress as many videos as you want. 

As long as you are running Linux, you can place this file in a directory with as many mp4 files as you would like. It will use x265 to compress them while keeping high quality. 

You can run options with the script to use your desired compression speed. The higher the speed, the lower the quality. Depending on the video, you might not notice much difference.

Available options:</br>
ultrafast</br>
superfast</br>
veryfast</br>
faster</br>
fast</br>
medium</br>
slow</br>
slower</br>
veryslow</br>

Example from Console:

bash compress.bs ultrafast


Default without options is set to faster.
